### Notes

npx create-react-app comes with npm install. It's already installed by default unlike mongoDB. Running npx will set up a react template for
you

// Import useState hook from React since React does not use normal DOM
// useState returns an array so we can split its values into 2 variables (object destructuring)

// useState can be used if you're changing values for multiple DOM elements
// useRef can be used if you're changing the styling of one DOM element
// useEffect can be used to run a function when a DOM element is rendered

### Installation

npx install create-react-app
npm i react-router-dom // for routing DOM (React has React Naive as well)
